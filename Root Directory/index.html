  <h1>WELCOME TO SCAM DETECTIVE</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">Scam Detective is a free-to-use web based application which allows users to input text, phone numbers, and email addresses and search for certain keywords, indicators, and origin in order to determine whether the sender is likely a scam. The idea being, people are constantly having their attention divided, especially on the internet. Being able to filter out unnecessary static is a huge convenience. The purpose of Scam Detective is to help people identify sources of scams so they can take further steps to protect themselves (block certain text numbers and email senders, request their phone number information be removed from call lists, etc). This is further enhanced since Scam Detective is free to use; the application is only monetized through ads, since the goal is to make this application accessible to everyone. To scan a message to see if it's likely a scam, navigate to the "Scam Detector" page. Once you're done submitting the data, go to the "See Results" page and Scam Detective will diagose whether the email/phone/text sender is likely scam.</p>
